# Pyber City Type Analysis (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

In this project, we were tasked with creating an anaylsis based on ride data from three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban. To accomplish this, we converted a csv file and compiled it to a readable, meaningful dataframe that showed metrics relevant to our analysis. These metrics included average fares by city and driver type, amount of trips for a period of time based on city type, and totals of rides and drivers for our three city types. We've compiled the cleaned up data to show data from January to March of 2019. Our goal was to utilize this data to find ways to help alleviate discrepencies between the three city types that we inspected. 

# Analysis

## Results (Urban Cities)
### Description

Urban Cities are far and away hold Pyber's largest volume of businss in all categories. The average fares are also the lowest in the category while drivers are making around 67% of the average fares per ride.

- Total Fare (USD$): $39,854.38
- Total Drivers: 2,405
- Total Rides: 1,624
- Average Fare (USD$)
  - Per Ride: $24.53
  - Per Driver: $16.37

## Results (Suburban Cities)
### Description

Suburban cities total fares are around half of that of urban cities. However, this is done with only 38% of the total rides that urban cities produced in the time frame that we have looked at. In addition, the amount of drivers is much lower than that of urban cities (20%) and the average ride count per driver is higher with drivers taking on at least one ride per driver, showing that the people driving are much more consistent with their interaction with the app. 

- Total Fare (USD$): $19,346.33
- Total Drivers: 490
- Total Rides: 625
- Average Fare (USD$)
  - Per Ride: $30.97
  - Per Driver: $39.50

## Results (Rural Cities)
### Description

As to be expected, rural cities make up the least amount of rides, drivers, and total fares. However, we see that being a driver is very lucrative for those drivers who are able to get fares, making it very attractive for drivers to interact with the app if they live in rural areas. This will be a important data point to examine for potential marketting in the future.

- Total Fare (USD$): $4,327.93
- Total Drivers: 78
- Total Rides: 125
- Average Fare (USD$)
  - Per Ride: $34.62
  - Per Driver $55.49


# Summary


By examining this data, we can see that there are vast differences between each of the three city types. Therefore, I believe it would be prudent to have at at least 2 different teams (suburban and urban as one team, rural as the other) focus on different city types. For urban cities, it would there needs to be more incentive for drivers who consistently show up as the turn over rate seems quite high. Perhaps, a partner program could be where drivers in urban cities get rewards (cash bonuses, vacations, free products for their vehicles). This could also be applied for the rider side of things where the more they use the app, the more rewards they'll receive. For suburban cities, I think marketting to the middle class would be very effective in increasing the amount of rides taken. Show the benefits of ride sharing for busy parents and market the safety standards for your drivers. Finally, for rural Pyber users, it's going to be a tough sell since cars are a necessity for people who's area is spread out. The most effective way of driving business in the rural climate is to focus on rural areas where tourism is popular.
